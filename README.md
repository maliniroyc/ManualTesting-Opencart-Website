# ManualTesting-Opencart Webapp 
The project is based on Agile project management using the JIRA tool to test Opencart website [https://demo-opencart.com/](url). The testing activities included designing and documenting test cases for different functionalities, executing test cases, and resolving identified issues. It includes test cases, test plans, and documentation to guide manual testers in evaluating the functionality and usability of OpenCart.

- *Methodology: Agile-Scrum methodology (Scrum framework)* <br>
- *Tools Used: Jira, Zephyr Scale* <br>
